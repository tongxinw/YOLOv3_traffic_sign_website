## About US

Hello, world! 

We are Masters in Data Science students at Brown Univeristy Data Science Initiative. Our group name is CodeBrew, which means we reply on cold brews :coffee: and we work on code brew :computer:.

This is a group project we created for DATA 2040 final project. This work focuses on computer vision.
